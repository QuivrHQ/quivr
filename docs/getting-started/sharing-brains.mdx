Quivr provides a powerful feature to share your brains with others. This can be done by sharing with individuals via their emails and assigning them specific rights. The rights can be categorized into three types: Viewer, Editor, and Owner.

## Types of User Rights

Each user type has different levels of access and capabilities within a shared [brain](/getting-started/brain). Here's a breakdown:

</Card>

<Card title="Editor" icon="pen">
