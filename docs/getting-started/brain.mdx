# Introduction to Brains

<Steps>
    <Step title="Specific to one thing">
        A brain is a simple unit that either stores information or is used to do a specific thing. Think of it as your second brain.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Holds information or Interact with Apps">
        A brain can be used to hold information or to interact with apps. For example, you can create a brain to hold information about your company or you can create a brain to interact with your CRM.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Shareable">
        Brains can be shared with other users of Quivr. This allows you to share information with your team or to share apps with your team.
    </Step>

# Two kinds of Brains

In Quivr, you can find two kinds of brains: **Document** and **App**.

The brains are here to help you store information or interact with apps. Let's see what each of them can do.
