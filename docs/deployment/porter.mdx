## Deploying Quivr Backend with Porter

[Porter](https://porter.run) is a platform that allows you to easily deploy, manage, and scale your applications. This guide will walk you through deploying the Quivr backend using Porter.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Porter account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [porter.run](https://porter.run).
- The Quivr backend source code. You can find it in the [Quivr GitHub repository](https://github.com/Quivr/quivr).

### Step 1: Create a Porter Project

1. Log in to your Porter account.
2. Click on the "New Project" button.
3. Give your project a name (e.g., "quivr-backend") and select a region.
4. Click "Create Project".

### Step 2: Configure the Porter.yaml File

When asked to create a new project, you will be prompted to create a `Porter.yaml` file. This file defines the services, build settings, and environment variables for your application.
You can give this file to help you deploy. 

```yaml
version: v2
name: quivr-back
services:
- name: flower
  run: celery -A celery_worker flower -l info --port=5555
  type: web
  instances: 1
  cpuCores: 0.1
  ramMegabytes: 200
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  port: 5555
  domains:
  - name: demo-flower.quivr.app
  sleep: false
- name: quivr-backend
  run: uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5050 --workers 6 --log-level
    info
  type: web
  instances: 2
  cpuCores: 1
  ramMegabytes: 2700
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  port: 5050
  domains:
  - name: demo-api.quivr.app
  healthCheck:
    enabled: true
    httpPath: /healthz
    timeoutSeconds: 20
    initialDelaySeconds: 60
  sleep: false
- name: quivr-beat
  run: celery -A celery_worker beat -l info
  type: worker
  instances: 1
  cpuCores: 0.1
  ramMegabytes: 200
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  sleep: false
- name: quivr-worker
  run: celery -A celery_worker worker -l info
  type: worker
  instances: 1
  cpuCores: 1
  ramMegabytes: 2030
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  sleep: false
build:
  context: ./backend/
  method: docker
  dockerfile: ./backend/Dockerfile
autoRollback:
  enabled: false
```


### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

In Porter, you can set environment variables for your services using the environment groups. Add the environment variables required for your Quivr backend to the an environment group in the the web portal.

These environment variables are the one you would normally set in your `.env` file when running the Quivr backend locally.


### Step 4: Deploy the frontend 


To deploy the Quivr frontend on Porter, use the following configuration in your `Porter.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: v2
name: quivr-demo-front
services:
- name: quivr-frontend
  run: ""
  type: web
  instances: 1
  cpuCores: 0.2
  ramMegabytes: 240
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  port: 3000
  domains:
  - name: demo.quivr.app
  sleep: false
build:
  context: ./frontend
  method: docker
  dockerfile: ./frontend/Dockerfile
autoRollback:
  enabled: false
```

### Step 5: Setup the environment variables for the frontend

Add the environment variables required for your Quivr frontend to the an environment group in the the web portal.

These environment variables are the one you would normally set in your `.env` file when running the Quivr frontend locally.

### Step 6: Deploy the Application

1. Click on the "Deploy" button in your Porter project.
2. Select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`).
3. Click "Deploy".

Porter will build and deploy your Quivr backend and frontend services based on the configuration in your `Porter.yaml` file.
