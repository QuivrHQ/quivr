Quivr uses its own telemetry service to track user interactions and usage. This guide will show you to deactivate or configure the telemetry service in Quivr.

## Telemetry Configuration

To configure the telemetry service in Quivr, you need to configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

By default, the `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` variable is set to `true`. If you want to deactivate the telemetry service, you can set it to `false`.

We only collect data that is necessary for improving the user experience and the quality of the service. We do not collect any personal data or sensitive information.
