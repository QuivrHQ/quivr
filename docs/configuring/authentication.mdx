# Authentication Methods

Quivr offers three authentication methods when self-hosting. You can choose which authentication methods you want to offer to your users from these three options:

1. **Email/Password Authentication**
2. **Google Authentication**
3. **Magic Link Authentication**

To enable one or more of these methods, you need to configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Authentication Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODES=magic_link,google_sso,password
```
Since each of these methods uses Supabase, you should configure your Supabase instance to support the chosen methods.

Please refer to the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) for more information on how to configure each authentication method.
