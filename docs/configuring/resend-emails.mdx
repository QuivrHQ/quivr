# Emails with Resend

Quivr uses the [Resend](https://resend.com/) service to send emails. Resend is a transactional email service that allows you to send emails from your application. This guide will show you how to set up Resend in Quivr.

## Setting up Resend

To set up Resend in Quivr, you need to configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Resend Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=<change-me>
RESEND_EMAIL_ADDRESS=<change-me>
RESEND_CONTACT_SALES_FROM=<change-me>
RESEND_CONTACT_SALES_TO=<change-me>
```

You can get the `RESEND_API_KEY` from your Resend account. The `RESEND_EMAIL_ADDRESS` is the email address that will be used to send emails from your application. The `RESEND_CONTACT_SALES_FROM` and `RESEND_CONTACT_SALES_TO` are the email addresses that will be used for sales-related inquiries.

Make sure that these emails and domains have been verified in your Resend account to avoid any issues with sending emails.
