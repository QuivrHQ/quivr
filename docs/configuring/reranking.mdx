Quivr uses its own reranking service to improve the quality of search results. This guide will show you how to configure the reranking service in Quivr.

## Reranking Configuration

We are using FlashrankRerank from [Flashrank](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/FlashRank) to improve the quality of search results. 
It is a reranking open-source library that uses deep learning models to rerank search results.

## Use Cohere ReRanker

To use the Cohere ReRanker, you need to configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key
```

By default, the `COHERE_API_KEY` variable is not set. If you want to use the Cohere ReRanker, you need to set it to your Cohere API key.

## Configuration

By default the Ranker outputs the best 5 results.

We only use the Cohere ReRanker to improve the quality of search results. We do not collect any personal data or sensitive information.
