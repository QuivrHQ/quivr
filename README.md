Quivr, helps you build your second brain, utilizes the power of GenerativeAI to be your personal assistant !

## Key Features üéØ

- **Opiniated RAG**: We created a RAG that is opinionated, fast and efficient so you can focus on your product
- **LLMs**: Quivr works with any LLM, you can use it with OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Gemma, etc.
- **Any File**: Quivr works with any file, you can use it with PDF, TXT, Markdown, etc and even add your own parsers.
- **Customize your RAG**: Quivr allows you to customize your RAG, add internet search, add tools, etc.
- **Integrations with Megaparse**: Quivr works with [Megaparse](https://github.com/quivrhq/megaparse), so you can ingest your files with Megaparse and use the RAG with Quivr.

>We take care of the RAG so you can focus on your product. Simply install quivr-core and add it to your project. You can now ingest your files and ask questions.*

**We will be improving the RAG and adding more features, stay tuned!**


This is the core of Quivr, the brain of Quivr.com.

## Getting Started üöÄ

You can find everything on the [documentation](https://core.quivr.com/).

### Prerequisites üìã

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10 or newer

### 30 seconds Installation üíΩ


- **Step 1**: Install the package

  

  ```bash
  pip install quivr-core # Check that the installation worked
  ```


- **Step 2**: Create a RAG with 5 lines of code

  ```python
  import tempfile

  from quivr_core import Brain

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w", suffix=".txt") as temp_file:
          temp_file.write("Gold is a liquid of blue-like colour.")
          temp_file.flush()

          brain = Brain.from_files(
              name="test_brain",
              file_paths=[temp_file.name],
          )

          answer = brain.ask(
              "what is gold? asnwer in french"
          )
          print("answer:", answer)
  ```
## Configuration

### Workflows

#### Basic RAG

![](docs/docs/workflows/examples/basic_rag.excalidraw.png)


Creating a basic RAG workflow like the one above is simple, here are the steps:


1. Add your API Keys to your environment variables
```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "myopenai_apikey"

```
Quivr supports APIs from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Mistral. It also supports local models using Ollama.

1. Create the YAML file ``basic_rag_workflow.yaml`` and copy the following content in it
```yaml
workflow_config:
  name: "standard RAG"
  nodes:
    - name: "START"
      edges: ["filter_history"]

    - name: "filter_history"
      edges: ["rewrite"]

    - name: "rewrite"
      edges: ["retrieve"]

    - name: "retrieve"
      edges: ["generate_rag"]

    - name: "generate_rag" # the name of the last node, from which we want to stream the answer to the user
      edges: ["END"]

# Maximum number of previous conversation iterations
# to include in the context of the answer
max_history: 10

# Reranker configuration
reranker_config:
  # The reranker supplier to use
  supplier: "cohere"

  # The model to use for the reranker for the given supplier
  model: "rerank-multilingual-v3.0"

  # Number of chunks returned by the reranker
  top_n: 5

# Configuration for the LLM
llm_config:

  # maximum number of tokens passed to the LLM to generate the answer
  max_input_tokens: 4000

  # temperature for the LLM
  temperature: 0.7
```

3. Create a Brain with the default configuration
```python
from quivr_core import Brain

brain = Brain.from_files(name = "my smart brain",
                        file_paths = ["./my_first_doc.pdf", "./my_second_doc.txt"],
                        )

```

4. Launch a Chat
```python
brain.print_info()

from rich.console import Console
from rich.panel import Panel
from rich.prompt import Prompt
from quivr_core.config import RetrievalConfig

config_file_name = "./basic_rag_workflow.yaml"

retrieval_config = RetrievalConfig.from_yaml(config_file_name)

console = Console()
console.print(Panel.fit("Ask your brain !", style="bold magenta"))

while True:
    # Get user input
    question = Prompt.ask("[bold cyan]Question[/bold cyan]")

    # Check if user wants to exit
    if question.lower() == "exit":
        console.print(Panel("Goodbye!", style="bold yellow"))
        break

    answer = brain.ask(question, retrieval_config=retrieval_config)
    # Print the answer with typing effect
    console.print(f"[bold green]Quivr Assistant[/bold green]: {answer.answer}")

    console.print("-" * console.width)

brain.print_info()
```

5. You are now all set up to talk with your brain and test different retrieval strategies by simply changing the configuration file!

## Go further

You can go further with Quivr by adding internet search, adding tools, etc. Check the [documentation](https://core.quivr.com/) for more information.
